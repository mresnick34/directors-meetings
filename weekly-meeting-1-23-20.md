### Agenda/Discussion

#### Blocking Issues
- Changes to Alpha feedback process for #20Communities Initiative
  - @persona: We do not have a representative sample of testers identified for rapid prototyping approach on #20communities.
  - Team suggestion was to engage up to 5 trusted partners and conduct feedback via moderated testing session.
  - Team B does not have testing resources/logistics to support.
  - Perhaps product team can help.
  - Decision point: Approach product team to assist in the moderated testing schedule/facilitation. A plan is needed by 2/15, as first release is ready 2/28.
    - Backup option is to seek outside assistance. That requires budget approval for an estimated cost of ~$XX,000.
  - Action Items: 
    - @mresnick34: Ask @persony if their team can provide this support ask in next cross functional team meeting. [1/29/20]
    - @personb: Send @mresnick34 a write up of the team proposal. [1-28-20]
    
 - Hosting upgrade change for Public API requires change to team Y work plan prior to 4/1/20
  - @personc The hosting team informed us of an upgrade change to AWS that requires an upgrade to service X for team Y for compatibility.
    - Current work plan doesn't have this time allocated.
    - Estimated LOE is one sprint for 3 developers, 2 testers to run full regression.
    - What work can we de-prioritize?
    - Current push on team Y to extend community endpoints is a dependency for the #20communities OKR.
    - Current push ends in three sprints. 
    - Does pausing cause testing issues?
      - @personb We do not have the testing resources to cover this. @persond Do you have QA team members availabile?
      - @persond We can move two automation testers for sprint F from 3/3 - 3/15 but they will not be familiar with the system.
      - Decision point: Approach QA team leader X about onboarding team D QA resources. Update resourcing plan to leave 3 weeks of time for this task, given the ramp up.
        - Action Items: @personb Determine/discuss branching strategy to minimize impacts to release K on 3/15 with team Y lead.
        
#### Recognition
- PersonXY went above and beyond to complete project Y ahead of schedule. The were code reviewing until the wee hours of the night.
- PersonGH worked hard with product on the accessibility initiative. They really showed leadership. Their career interest is to be a team lead - are there any opportunities on team X for them?
 - Action Items: 
  - @personb To confirm with @personc what work could use a new team lead's help. [2-05-20]
  - @personb Craft a pilot for @personc's review and approval. [2-15-20]
